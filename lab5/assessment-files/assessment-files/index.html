            <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
            
            <p>By Evan Wild</p>

            <!-- Content wrapped in <p> tags [4] -->
            <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.</p>
            <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>

            <!-- H3 text matched to screenshot [1], [2] -->
            <h3>Types of bear</h3>
            <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>
            <p>Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the forests and mountains. They are highly adaptable creatures, and this is why they have been able to successfully inhabit many different continents.</p>
